Hi! I am computer scientist specializing in data science and machine learning. I have also spent several years in embedded systems and web technology because I enjoy constantly learning new things. I generally prefer the C/Python world over web technology/React/JavaScript but can operate in both. Rust is my current learning passion. Take a look at some of my repositories down below. 👇🏻
